### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. The innerHTML property used with the document.getElementById() sets or returns the HTML content (inner HTML) of an element.
2. clearButton method: This method is executed when the 'Clear Calculator' button is clicked.  It removes the tax calculations and the values the user typed in the form.  It also resets the filing status back to 'Single' filing status.
3. The getElementById() method is used to find the element on the HTML page with the specified id and overwrite the existing values with the empty string or a set value. This clears out the results.
